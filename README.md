updating statuses and adding friends.

To start off, login using one of the following names (no password needed for simplicity):
-Jessika

-Abdul

These preset accounts will have preset statuses and friends. Feel free to log in and out to each one of them.

You can be amibitious and create a new account. If you choose this route, you will have blank status and no friends.
Try adding one of the existing preset friends and expand your network!

Enjoy!
